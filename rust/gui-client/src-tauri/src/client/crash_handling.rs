//! A module for handling crashes and writing minidump files
//!
//! Mostly copied from <https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/crash-handling/blob/main/minidumper/examples/diskwrite.rs>
//!
//! TODO: Capture crash dumps on panic. <https://github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/3520>
//!
//! To get human-usable stack traces out of a dump, do this:
//! (Copied from <https://github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/3111#issuecomment-1887975171>)
//!
//! - Get the pdb corresponding to the client exe
//! - `cargo install dump_syms`
//! - Use dump_syms to convert the pdb to a syms file
//! - Compile `minidump-stackwalk` with PR 891 merged
//! - `minidump-stackwalker --symbols-path firezone.syms crash.dmp`
